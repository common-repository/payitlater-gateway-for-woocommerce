PayItLater gateway for WooCommerce allows Australian customers to check out and pay later with the PayItLater service.

== Description ==

PayItLater allows your customers to buy now and pay later - with regular automated instalments. Adding a buy now and pay later payment option to your store measurably increases average cart value and conversions.

You must have WooCommerce installed and configured to offer PayItLater to your customers.

Useful functionality in the plugin:

* Payment iframe to securely collect cardholder data from customers and authorize payments
* Robust, secure, PCI-DSS compliant payments platform for processing deferred payments
* Initiate refunds and notify us you have shipped your order

You'll need an active [PayItLater.com.au merchant account](https://www.payitlater.com.au/merchant-get-started/) to view the payment gateway. Before we allow production access to the system we require identity verification documentation from merchants.

== Installation ==

Install and activate the PayItLater plugin in your WordPress blog.

Visit WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > PayItLater.

Enter your test Merchant ID and Secret Key you received from us. Enable PayItLater.

Place a test order in your store checkout (carry out any styling required!)

Contact us for your production Merchant ID and Secret Key. Install them in PayItLater settings and you are now live!

== Screenshots ==

1. Your customers simply select PayItLater at checkout to use our innovative deferred payments platform.
2. The plugin helps the user decide if they will use deferred payments with extra information available.
3. On checking out with PayItLater, the user is presented with a secure iframe that walks them through the approval and payment process.
